# loventre-extensions

This repository contains **non-canonical extensions** of the Loventre model.

It is explicitly **not part of the formal CANON** and must not be cited
as a proof repository.

---

## Purpose

This repository hosts:

- experimental metrics
- exploratory curvature definitions
- numerical or symbolic experiments
- prototype engines
- conceptual bridges to classical complexity theory
- technical notes and research directions

Everything here is **optional**, **revisable**, and **non-binding**.

---

## Relationship to the CANON

The formal, frozen, auditable core of the Loventre model lives in:

> `loventre-coq-canon`

This repository:

- may evolve
- may be rewritten
- may be partially incorrect
- may contain speculative material

No result here is considered formally valid unless
it is **ported and re-proven** inside the CANON repository.
